## Artist Statement

The blockchain is a data structure that creates institutional memory.[1] By solving the [Byzantine Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance#Byzantine_Generals.27_Problem), the blockchain enables a group of individuals to agree that an event happened without any of these individuals needing to trust each other. Once consensus is reached about what happened nobody can tamper with the record of events. The record is further accessible to anyone who wishes to see it.

While the institutional memory that the blockchain creates is typically used to keep track of financial transactions, we cannot forget that financial transactions are social in nature. When Alice pays Bob 2.2 BTC for watching her dog she leaves a permanent artifact about the relationship between Alice and Bob. More than anything, the blockchain is a permanent and immutable record of human interactions.

The inability to forget an interaction is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand it enables a host of exotic and disruptive technologies such as cryptocurrencies; on the other hand, it creates a slate that can never truly be wiped clean. If Alice hurts Bob by cheating him on a transaction then that transaction will be remembered forever. It doesn't matter if Bob forgives Alice in the end---the blockchain is incapable of removing the transaction and allowing Bob or society at large to forget that Alice cheated him.

How should we forgive, then, when we are unable to forget? How can we right a wrong that may repeatedly bubble up from the limitless memory of the blockchain?

TetzelCoin is a cryptocurrency designed to be a token for forgiveness. Since we cannot forgive and forget, users are able to define their sins in monetary terms and take appropriate action to correct their misdeeds.

Drawing on the history of the Catholic church, TetzelCoin defines an "appropriate" action as a kind of digital indulgence. While now no longer in use, indulgences previously allowed for a Christian to reduce their punishment for a sin after death by paying a "pardoner" money. The pardoner typically detailed exactly how much time off of purgatory could be exchanged for the money given. The practice was famously abused by Dominican friar [Johann Tetzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Tetzel) leading up to the Protestant Reformation.

TetzelCoin's indulgences take a slightly different form. Since we do not know if a user has already confessed their sin, TetzelCoin requires a user to confess their sin to a priest-like smart contract in addition to simply paying it money for absolution. In return, users are given a token of their forgiveness in the form of TetzelCoin cryptocurrency. The amount of TetzelCoin each user receives is directly proportional to how much money is given. The confession and the amount of TetzelCoin that resulted from the transaction are recorded in the blockchain and displayed in a ledger of sins that anyone can view.

The proceeds from TetzelCoin will go to The Tetzel Fund, a 501(c )(3) that will purchase and cancel medical debt in the United States. Why? Seen in monetary terms, sins are frequently described as being a kind of debt. When we sin, we "owe" something to a person we may have harmed, society as a whole or God. Conversely, many societies view debtors unfavorably, regardless of how they became indebted. Having quantified our sins with TetzelCoin, we have the unique opportunity to exchange between "sins" by using the proceeds from TetzelCoin to purchase debt, another kind of sin. However, in this case we can further right our wrongs by choosing to buy and cancel medical debt, a debt born out of an unjust system that disproportionately harms the poor.

[1] For an excellent treatment of the blockchain and memory I highly recommend Venkatesh Rao's [Blockchains Never Forget](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/05/25/blockchains-never-forget/), which served as an inspiration for this piece.

## Technology

The central technological innovation in TetzelCoin is the use of the smart contract as a spirtual intermediary. While TetzelCoin endorses no religion or god in particular, we are able to invoke the presence of the divine by taking advantage of the emerging technology of the blockchain. The blockchain gives an air of absolute authority by virtue of its immutability, uncensorability and permanence, and its decentralized design lends it a feeling of omnipresence. As perhaps the ultimate test of a new, spiritual technology, the blockchain is difficult to understand and correspondingly "feels like magic."

Ethereum, with its highly-developed smart contract capabilities, was a natural choice for this project. The Ethereum community frequently recites the mantra "code is law," a statement with radically mixed messages. One the one hand, "code is law" is an aspirational expression of how Ethereum and related technologies could transform society into a techno-utopia where the superior logic of software conquers the irrationality of humans and markets; on the other hand, it's a concrete reminder of the dangerous consequences of relying on an inflexible, cold system where a single typo can cause financial ruin.

While Ethereum's technology is certainly "magical" its financial applications are perhaps even more so. Money holds deep spiritual importance in our hyper-capitalist world. To be wealthy is to be a demi-god. While the power of wealthy individuals certainly commands respect, we go at extra lengths to deify them and give them super-human characteristics. Even if we do not preach the prosperity gospel we know it to be true in our hearts.

As a financial technology, then, Ethereum takes on even greater significance. Fortunes have been made with ICOs and trading extraordinarily voltaile cryptoassets. Even greater fortunes await as cryptoassets and decentralization technology begin to disrupt both finance and government. As a technology, Ethereum holds unprecedented spiritual power.

If code is both law and money, then code governs and defines the relationships of individuals and society at large. Why not, then, have code govern our relationship to ourselves and to the cosmos? 

The code for TetzelCoin is open source and can be found at the [TetzelCoin repository](https://github.com/wdoenlen/tetzelcoin) on GitHub.
